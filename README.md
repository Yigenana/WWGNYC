# WWG NYC

This is the New York City Chapter of [Women Who Go](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Go/). This group is an inclusive space for women, non-binary and transgender people with an interest in the Go programming language, or programming in general. All participants are expected to follow the [Go Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct).

This repo contains code samples and slides from Women Who Go NYC events. Events are organized through [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-Women-Who-Go/). You can also find us in the Women Who Go Slack group, which you can request access to here: https://www.womenwhogo.org/invite.html .
