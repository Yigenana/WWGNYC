# Women Who Go NYC
## Intro to Golang

This repo contains a PDF of the slides from the Women Who Go NYC Intro to Go training from 2020. This workshop is based off of the training from [Johnny Boursiquot](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/jboursiquot/learn-to-code-with-go-workshop/details).

The repo also contains solutions for each exercise and an example solution for the first Project of the workshop, which summarizes several concepts taught. Note, the solutions are intended to be demonstrative and highlight one possible approach to solving the exercises. Other solutions are acceptable and you're encouraged to try different approaches to solving each problem.
